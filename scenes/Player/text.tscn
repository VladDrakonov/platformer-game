maze, but it was so big that I 
got lost. Between the different 
paths, traps, etc., I finally 
succumbed. If you see this 
sign, just a piece of advice, if 
you reappear in another place, 
it means you are at a 
checkpoint and that itâ€™s the 
right place. Keep going like 
this, good luck survivor.

note: i'm a survivor of the 
hydrakan village, my family
are here, pls help her"
